## Baur Ionut-Gabriel :: Technical Profile

With 11 years of experience as a software developer with Java related technologies, I have worked on many projects in different areas, starting with developing and maintaining complex applications in the Banking sector for my first employer, where I developed my programming skills, which were later refined and improved. Given the old tech stack used, I then decided to accept the challenge to work on projects from other areas as well, with newer and various technologies. I am willing to learn new things and to adapt to the newest stuff in order to continuously develop my skills, therefore I also started about two years ago the challenge to teach Java to beginners, being a Trainer at an IT courses company.
